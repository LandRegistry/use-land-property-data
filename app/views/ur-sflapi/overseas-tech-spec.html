    <!-- OVERVIEW -->
    <h2 id="overview" class="govuk-heading-l">Overview</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      This dataset is a list of freehold or leasehold title registrations held by HM Land Registry, covering England
      and Wales, where the registered legal owner is an overseas company (a company incorporated outside of the UK).
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      Titles registered by private individuals, UK companies with an overseas address and charities are excluded for
      data protection and fraud prevention purposes.
    </p>

    <!-- SPECIFICATION SCOPE -->
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="scope">Specification scope</h2>
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Inclusion and exclusions</h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      We register legal estates, or ownership, and legal interests (legal rights or restrictions). The Overseas companies
      that own property in England and Wales dataset describes registered legal estates relating to land or property
      where the registered legal owner is an overseas company (a company incorporated outside of the UK).
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      The data includes titles registered by the following owner types of:
    </p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>corporate bodies</li>
      <li>limited companies</li>
      <li>public limited companies</li>
      <li>unlimited companies</li>
      <li>limited liability partnerships</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      The data excludes titles registered by the following owner types of:
    </p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>private individuals</li>
      <li>UK companies with an overseas address</li>
      <li>charities</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      If an excluded owner type is the sole owner, all the details (such as address, name and correspondence address,
      tenure, title) will be excluded from the dataset.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      If a registered title is owned by both included and excluded owner types, the excluded owner details will be
      removed from the name, proprietorship and correspondence address columns.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      Example: When a property is owned by a limited company and private individuals, we will supply the details of
      the property address, tenure, title and the name and correspondence address for the limited company, but will
      remove all reference to the private individuals. An indicator will be displayed to highlight there are other proprietors.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      Email addresses and British Forces Post Office addresses have been removed from the correspondence address records.
      These are considered private and personal.
    </p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Relationship to other HM Land Registry data products</h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      The dataset is aligned in content, download and usage options with our <a href="uk-product">UK companies that
      own property in England and Wales</a> which contains more than 3.2 million records of titles registered to a
      UK commercial organisation or corporate body.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      The title number allows relational links to be made with other HM Land Registry datasets that also contain the title number.

    <p class="govuk-body">
      During more than 150 years of land registration, improvements to working practice may have caused some
      inconsistencies in the data, as shown below.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      Only completed register entries are included. No pending applications (meaning applications still being processed
      at HM Land Registry) or historic owners are included.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      HM Land Registry did not routinely record the country of incorporation in the register before January 1999.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      The information provided regarding owners may not always reflect the position in the register, as we have had
      to remove private individuals, overseas companies and charities.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      The source data is from citizens and conveyancers supplied on registration deeds and documents. There can often
      be inconsistency in the way addresses and names are supplied to HM Land Registry.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      There may be spelling errors in the names of the owners. This could be due to input error or the way the names
      were presented at the time of registration.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      Detailed address information is provided wherever possible.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      The postcode will be derived from the registered property description; if one hasn’t been registered then the
      postcode will be blank.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      The ‘registered on’ date is the date the proprietor was registered. If there is more than one proprietor in the
      register it will be the date the latest proprietor was added. This could mean it is not necessarily when the
      overseas company was registered, but another proprietor in the register whose details cannot be revealed.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      If there is a ‘Y’ in the Multiple Address Indicator, this will indicate there is a Property Schedule for the
      title and no A1 register entry address is available. Within the Property Schedule there will more than likely
      be one address and if you would like to find out more about these addresses you can purchase an official copy
      of the register.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      For Price Paid only be a limited number of the titles will have an amount stated. These figures have been derived
      from the monthly Property Price Information (PPI) information based on the latest application.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="capture">Data capture information</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      An overseas corporation will become owner of a registered property when land is transferred to it or leased under
      a registerable lease. The transfer or lease must be completed by registration or, if the land is unregistered,
      it will trigger first registration of the land.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      An application for registration must be made using prescribed forms; this will be form AP1 for registered land
      or form FR1 for first registration. The form requires the applicant to state the territory of incorporation of
      the corporation and, if it has a registered number in England and Wales, the registration number and prefix.
      Other HM Land Registry forms, such as transfer form TR1, also require the applicant to state the territory of
      incorporation of the corporation and, if it has a registered number in England and Wales, the registration number
      and prefix. When we enter the corporation in the register, HM Land Registry practice is to enter the territory
      of incorporation and any registration number. This has been the case since 1997.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      In some countries, a corporation is registered in a particular state or province. In this case, HM Land Registry
      enters both the state or province and the country. For example: #MONTBLANC HOLDINGS LIMITED# (incorporated in
      British Columbia, Canada).
    </p>

      During a month, the data can change and can also change more than once. The data that is published will only
