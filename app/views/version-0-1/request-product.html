      <h2 id="about" class="govuk-heading-l">About requests for information</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        HM Land Registry sends a request for information if we receive a register update or register create application
        that does not have enough information. We’ll also request information if there are inconsistencies in the
        documentation we receive.
      </p>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Register update applications</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        These are applications to change the details on an existing register. For example, recording the names of
        new owners of a property.
      </p>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Register create applications</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        These are applications that involve creating a brand-new title, for example a property being registered for
        the first time.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-inset-text">
        There are more requests for information in register create applications. This is because they are more complex
        than register update applications. Conveyancers whose business involves more new titles may therefore receive
        more requests for information than a firm with a different profile of work.
      </p>

      <h2 id="why" class="govuk-heading-l">Why we send requests for information</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Sometimes, HM Land Registry sends a request for information through no fault of the applicant or a third party.
        Examples include:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>
          where HM Land Registry is exercising its power to ask for more information under
          <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2003/1417/article/17/made">rule 17 of the Land Registration Rules 2003</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          where HM Land Registry sends a request for information in error - we are taking steps to avoid this
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Sometimes, issues arise from errors and oversights by conveyancers and in other cases, from third parties not
        providing the evidence they need on time. Examples include:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>no evidence of consents by third parties</li>
        <li>no evidence of mortgages being paid off</li>
        <li>name discrepancies</li>
        <li>documents not being signed or witnessed properly</li>
        <li>no evidence of the authority of attorneys to sign documents</li>
      </ul>
