          corporations aggregate (a separate legal entity formed by more than one individual person. The corporate
          aggregate has an existence which is separate from the persons comprising it. The term is used to distinguish
          them from corporations sole which are legal entities consisting of a single person at any one time)

        <li>UK Companies with an overseas correspondence address</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        The dataset excludes titles where the registered owners are:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>private individuals</li>
        <li>overseas companies</li>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        If an excluded owner type is the sole owner, all details will be removed from the dataset.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        If a registered title is owned by both included and excluded owner types, the excluded owner details will be
        removed from the name, proprietorship and correspondence address columns. An indicator will be displayed to
        highlight there are other proprietors.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Email addresses and British Forces Post Office addresses have been removed from the correspondence address records.
        These are considered private and personal.

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Relationship to other HM Land Registry data products</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        The dataset is aligned with <a href="overseas-product">Overseas companies that own property in England and Wales</a>
        . It contains approximately 100,000 records, which describes titles registered to an overseas company or
        corporate body.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        The title number allows relational links to be made with other HM Land Registry datasets that also
        contain the title number.

        During more than 150 years of land registration, improvements to working practice may have caused some
        inconsistencies in the data.
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>
          Only completed register entries are included. No pending applications or historic owners are included.
        </li>
        <li>
          The information about owners may not always reflect the position on the Register, as we do not include
          information about private individuals, overseas companies and charities.
        </li>
        <li>
          The source data is from information supplied by citizens, corporate bodies and conveyancers on registration
          deeds and documents. There is often inconsistency in the way in which addresses and names are supplied to
          Land Registry.
        </li>
        <li>
          There may be spelling errors in the ownership names. This could be due to input error or the way in which
          they were presented.
        </li>
        <li>
          Detailed address information is provided wherever possible.
        </li>
        <li>
          The postcode is taken from the registered property description. If one hasn’t been registered then the
          postcode will be blank.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Date Proprietor Added is the date the proprietor was registered. When Land Registry registers a
          proprietor, the date of registration is usually entered in the register. This date is automatically
          entered but may be overwritten and left blank, for example, where two individual titles are amalgamated.
          Approx. 2% of titles in this dataset have a blank field. Where a date is shown this might not be the
          date that the proprietor was first registered. For example, it might be the date of the last registered
          property transfer where one owner remains the same.
        </li>
        <li>
          There are typographic errors in Company Registration Numbers.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is possible for a Company Registration Number to legitimately be associated with more than one company.
          For example, if a company changed its name and did not update the property record. Clerical or format
          errors may show a mismatch between company name and registration number.  There was no obligation to
          record a Company Registration Number before 1 January 1997. However, approx. 2% of LTD or PLC titles
          registered after this date have no Company Registration Number due to errors made.
        </li>
        <li>
          There are some errors where an incorrect proprietorship has been selected during registration.
        </li>
        <li>
          If we find any overseas Companies, charities or private individuals have been included in this
