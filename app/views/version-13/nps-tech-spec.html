      The National Polygon Dataset (NPD) is the published dataset of HM Land Registry (HMLR) Index Polygons for
      England and Wales.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      HMLR registers ownership of land and property in England and Wales. On completion of a registered title
      HMLR produces a title plan (in most cases), a register and one or more index polygons.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      The title plan and register record the general position of the boundaries of a registered title
      (unless shown as having been determined as an exact boundary).
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      An index polygon is part of the Index referred to in s68, 2002 Land Registration Act and r10, Land
      Registration Rules 2003. Its purpose is to provide an index to show the indicative location of a
      registered title. Index polygons are held in vector format.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      The title plan and register share the same ID called the title number. Every registered title has at least
      one index polygon.  An index polygon has a unique Polygon ID (Poly_ID). The relationship between the registered
      title and index polygon(s) is managed through the title number.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      HMLR index polygons are mapped against Ordnance Survey (OS) large scale data, MasterMap. Index polygons will
      follow features in MasterMap where those features relate to the ownership boundary. Ownership boundaries do
      not always follow features mapped in MasterMap. A feature could be for example, a road, path or hedge.

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="capture">Data capture information</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      An index polygon is a representation of the title extent. HM Land Registry practice allows for an index
      polygon extent to be the same size, larger or smaller than the extent shown on the title plan. This means
      they should not be relied on to show the exact extent of registered titles. The dataset includes polygons
      based on former practices and does contain inconsistencies.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      Index polygons were manually captured on OS county series sheets, national grid sheets and parcels books.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      In February 2004 HM Land Registry completed a project to convert 19 million index polygons from paper format
      to vectorised polygons. These polygons were mapped against OS Land-Line.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      With so many polygons to vectorise within a finite time frame, HMLR was pragmatic in achieving an effective
      and efficient capture at that time. This meant that we introduced temporary practice, index polygons were
      completed pictorially and title plans were seldom used to validate an indexed extent.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      Index polygons affected by the OS’ Positional Accuracy Programme (PAI) were subsequently amended.  HM Land
      Registry’s PAI program ran from 2005 to 2008.  Many were moved in sympathy with the OS mapping. This was
      done through an automated process. Those that did not meet certain criteria were referred for manual
      investigation whereby index polygons were manually compared with the title plan.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      Around 2009 HMLR embarked on a quality initiative called the Quality Improvement Flowline (QIF); almost
      14 million index polygons went through this process.  Some minor overlaps were resolved and extent matching
      was done automatically, each index polygon was reconciled with the title plan.  By this time HM Land Registry
      was taking OS MasterMap (OSMM), the new large-scale map product from Ordnance Survey which replaced LandLine.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      HMLR receives a daily change only update (COU) of OSMM but this is used for the creation of new Index Polygons
      and Title Plans, rather than to review or update current registrations. Index Polygons will be updated when
      there is appropriate activity on a title, or an adjoining title demands a change.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      Large scale OS map products (OS LandLine and OSMM) capture features at various scales 1:1,250 for urban areas,
      1:2,500 for semi urban and rural areas and 1:10,000 for mountain and moorland areas.
    </p>

      All HMLR data including index polygons are captured to British National Grid.

          It is difficult to interpret an index map where there are multiple titles in one building. HMLR captures
          footprint index polygons to deal with this.<br>
          Footprint indexing involves the capture of an area larger than the title extent. Normally the footprint
          will be captured to the defined boundaries of a building shown on OSMM. The index polygon is captured
          to the smallest footprint that fully accommodates the title extent.<br>
          Where the registered title comprises land that falls outside the building footprint e.g. garden ground
          / parking space this should be shown as a separate polygon(s) with an indicative extent.<br>

          Where a large number of floor level registrations affect an unusually large defined area on the OSMM
          (typically a shopping mall or similar development) indexing to the footprint of the whole development
          makes interrogating the index map less effective.<br>
          HMLRs mapping system struggles to deal with a huge amount of multiple layered polygons. In such circumstances
          HMLR may be divide the area into smaller artificial footprint areas within the building footprint.<br>
          If it is difficult to clearly show small registrations that are not defined on the OSMM. We may capture a
          larger artificial footprint to include all the small areas.<br>

          be reduced in size to allow for the strip to be shown with a 1m width.<br>
