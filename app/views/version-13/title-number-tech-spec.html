      The Title Number/UPRN Look Up Dataset contains title numbers from HM Land Registry and Unique Property
      Reference Numbers (UPRN) from Ordnance Survey’s AddressBase. It covers registered properties in England
      and Wales that have an association to an address containing a UPRN reference.

    <p class=govuk-body">
      HM Land Registry (HMLR) records addresses at registration. We link them with Ordnance Survey AddressBase data
      if possible. If it is not possible we’ll create the new address.
    </p>
    <p class=govuk-body">
      HMLR match their created addresses and title numbers to new AddressBase addresses when they become available.
    </p>
    <p class=govuk-body">
      The title number and UPRNs can only be linked where we can make a relationship between Ordnance Survey's
      AddressBase address and the title number.

      They have been separated so that the datasets are smaller and easier to manage and maintain.

    <p class=govuk-body">
      As part of the address searching, ingest and matching process it is possible that:
    </p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>
        duplicate addresses may exist because the information supplied does not match the address in the Land
        Registry Property Gazetteer (LRPG). This could result in two addresses in LRPG, one with a title number
        and no UPRN, the other with a UPRN but no title number.
      </li>
      <li>
        an address exists with a UPRN but is not in LRPG and therefore has no title number associated with it
      </li>
    </ul>
        
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="capture">Data capture information</h2>
    <p class=govuk-body">
      In the 1990s, HM Land Registry (HMLR) created its first national address database, populated with
      residential Postcode Address File (PAF) addresses from Royal Mail.  Before this we used addressing
      data sourced from street card indexes and local gazetteers.
    </p>
    <p class=govuk-body">
      In 2002 we moved to our current addressing database - Land Registry Property Gazetteer (LRPG). LRPG used
      AddressPoint data from the Ordnance Survey to provide a base of national addresses and where appropriate
      linked our customer address and title numbers to the AddressPoint address.
    </p>
    <p class=govuk-body">
      In 2011 HMLR adopted Ordnance Survey MasterMap and moved from Address-Point to AddressLayer2.
    </p>
    <p class=govuk-body">
      In 2014 HMLR moved from AddressLayer 2 to AddressBase as our source of national addresses. LRPG ingests the
      post office PAF data from AddressBase to maintain consistency with the addressing that we used to take from
      AddressPoint and AddressLayer 2.  We created the Title Number and UPRN look up dataset by linking AddressBase
      data to our title numbers.
    </p>
    <p class=govuk-body">
      Some post office addresses that do not match Local Authority addresses have been excluded from AddressBase.
      They do not have a UPRN and will not be available in this dataset.
    </p>
    <p class=govuk-body">
      We created LRPG to enable us to make relationships between title numbers and addresses. We make the
      association when a property is registered.
    </p>
    <p class=govuk-body">
      Where there is no address found in LRPG, HM Land Registry creates its own.
    </p>
    <p class=govuk-body">
      Where a title number affects many properties, all affecting UPRNs may be associated.
    </p>
    <p class=govuk-body">
      If an AddressBase address has not been transferred to LRPG, there will be no UPRN for that title even if one exists.
    </p>
        
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="maintenance">Data maintenance</h2>
    <p class=govuk-body">
      Every 6 weeks HM Land Registry takes a change only update file of AddressBase.  The data is imported and
      matched so that the LRPG is updated and title associations are made.
    </p>
    <p class=govuk-body">
      The data can change several times during the six weeks. The published data will only show the last change made.
