                        annually in advance on the Start Date (and, where renewed under clause 6.2, on the Renewal

                Where You choose to pay the Charges by instalments under clause 5.2 b), We will also make an
                administration charge of £100 per instalment. The administration charge is payable with the instalment.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Charges will be reviewed each year. We will give You three months’ notice in writing of the
