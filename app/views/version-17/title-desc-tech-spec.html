    <p class=govuk-body">
      The Title Descriptor dataset gives the estate interest and class of title for each registered estate and
      interest in England and Wales.
    </p>
    <p class=govuk-body">
      The class of title describes how confident the Registrar is in the establishment of ownership at registration.
      The class of title is used by property professionals to guide their approach to decision making when dealing
      with the registered title.
    </p>
    <p class=govuk-body">
      Each registered estate or interest has a unique title number. A title number can only have one class of title.
    </p>
    
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="scope">Specification scope</h2>
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Inclusions and exclusions</h3>
    <p class=govuk-body">
      The Title Descriptor data is a sub-set of the Land Register containing all registered titles relating to land
      or property. Every registered title will always have a title number, an estate and class of title.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      If there is an application awaiting registration there will be an associated title number, but no information
      about the estate or class of title.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      The dataset also shows applications for registration that HM Land Registry has started but not yet completed.
    </p>
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Relationship to other HM Land Registry data products</h3>
    <p class=govuk-body">
      The Title descriptor dataset is closely linked to the <a href="nps-tech-spec">National Polygon</a>
      and <a href="title-number-tech-spec">UPRN</a> datasets. They have been separated so that the datasets are
      smaller and easier to manage and maintain.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      The title number is a unique identifier that can be linked to other HM land Registry data.

    <p class=govuk-body">
      When land is registered for the first time we record if the land is held under freehold or leasehold. We also
      record details from applications for new leases. 
    </p>
    <p class=govuk-body">
      The class of title given depends on the strength of the evidence of title lodged.  There are 3 classes of
      title for freehold land and 4 for leasehold land.  The best class of title is absolute.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      A qualified title may be granted if there is a specific defect in title.  This defect will be specified
      in the register. 
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      A possessory title is granted where the title is held under adverse possession or the title deeds have
      been lost or destroyed.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      A good leasehold title may be granted where we do not have evidence of the landlord’s right to grant the
      lease.  On a lease out of a registered title, we grant good leasehold where we do not have documentary
      evidence of the landlord’s title back to the freehold and the landlord’s title is not registered with
      absolute title.

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="maintenance">Data maintenance</h2>
    <p class=govuk-body">
      The tenure of the title does not change.  The class of title can change if the class of title is not absolute
      and an application is made with the correct evidence supplied. Where the class of title is not absolute, an
      application can be made to upgrade the class of title.  The evidence needed will depend on the current class
      of title.
