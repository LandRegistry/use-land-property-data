    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="overview">Overview</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      HM Land Registry published this version of the dataset from November 2015 to October 2017. It was published
      quarterly and shows freehold or leasehold registered titles that were legally owned by a company.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="scope">Specification scope</h2>
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Inclusions and exclusions</h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      The data may contain registrations by the following owner types:
    </p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>
        corporations aggregate (a separate legal entity formed by more than one individual person. The corporate
        aggregate has an existence which is separate from the persons comprising it. The term is used to distinguish
        them from corporations sole which are legal entities consisting of a single person at any one time)
      </li>
      <li>county councils</li>
      <li>other local authorities</li>
      <li>housing associations</li>
      <li>industrial and provident societies</li>
      <li>registered societies</li>
      <li>limited companies</li>
      <li>public limited companies</li>
      <li>unlimited companies</li>
      <li>limited liability partnerships</li>
      <li>community interest companies</li>
      <li>Societas Europaea (where registered at Companies House)</li>
      <li>UK Companies with an overseas correspondence address</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      The data excludes titles where the registered owners are:
    </p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>private individuals</li>
      <li>overseas companies</li>
      <li>charities including Charitable Incorporated Organisations (CIO)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      If an excluded owner type is the sole owner, all details will be removed from the dataset.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      If a registered title is owned by both included and excluded owner types, the excluded owner details will be
      removed from the name, proprietorship and correspondence address columns. An indicator will be displayed to
      highlight there are other proprietors.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      Email addresses and British Forces Post Office addresses have been removed from the correspondence address records.
      These are considered private and personal.
    </p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Relationship to other HM Land Registry data products</h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      The dataset is aligned with the <a href="overseas-product">Overseas companies that own property in England and Wales</a>.
      It contains approximately 100,000 records, which describes titles registered to an overseas company or
      corporate body.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      The title number allows relational links to be made with other HM Land Registry datasets that also
      contain the title number.

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="quality">Data quality</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      During more than 150 years of land registration, improvements to working practice may have caused some
      inconsistencies in the data.
    </p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>
        Only completed register entries are included. No pending applications or historic owners are included.
      </li>
      <li>
        The information about owners may not always reflect the position on the Register, as we do not include
        information about private individuals, overseas companies and charities.
      </li>
      <li>
        The source data is from information supplied by citizens, corporate bodies and conveyancers on registration
        deeds and documents. There is often inconsistency in the way in which addresses and names are supplied to
        Land Registry.
      </li>
      <li>
        There may be spelling errors in the ownership names. This could be due to input error or the way in which
        they were presented.
      </li>
      <li>
        Detailed address information is provided wherever possible.
      </li>
      <li>
        The postcode is taken from the registered property description. If one hasn’t been registered then the
        postcode will be blank.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Date Proprietor Added is the date the proprietor was registered. When HM Land Registry registers a
        proprietor, the date of registration is usually entered in the register. This date is automatically
        entered but may be overwritten and left blank, for example, where two individual titles are amalgamated.
        Approx. 2% of titles in this dataset have a blank field. Where a date is shown this might not be the
        date that the proprietor was first registered. For example, it might be the date of the last registered
        property transfer where one owner remains the same.
      </li>
      <li>
        There are typographic errors in Company Registration Numbers.
      </li>
      <li>
        It is possible for a Company Registration Number to legitimately be associated with more than one company.
        For example, if a company changed its name and did not update the property record. Clerical or format
        errors may show a mismatch between company name and registration number. There was no obligation to
        record a Company Registration Number before 1 January 1997. However, approx. 2% of LTD or PLC titles
        registered after this date have no Company Registration Number due to errors made.
      </li>
      <li>
        There are some errors where an incorrect proprietorship has been selected during registration.
      </li>
      <li>
        If we find any overseas Companies, charities or private individuals have been included in this
        dataset, we’ll remove them.
      </li>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="capture">Data capture information</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      The data is collected when property is transferred or leased to a non-private individual. During the
      application process the Company Registration Number is recorded. This has been the case since 1997.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      HM Land Registry does not validate Company Registration Numbers. Other types of corporations may be
      allocated a number by their registration authority.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      We take customer addresses at registration and check them against Ordnance Survey AddressBase data if
      possible. We’ll create a new address in our register if there’s no match.
