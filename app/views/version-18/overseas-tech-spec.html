    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

      If an excluded owner type is the sole owner, all the details will be excluded from the dataset.
    </p>

      If a registered title is owned by both included and excluded owner types, the excluded owner details will be
      removed from the name, proprietorship and correspondence address columns.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      An indicator will be displayed to highlight there are other proprietors.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      Email addresses and British Forces Post Office addresses have been removed from the correspondence address records.
      These are considered private and personal.

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Relationship to other HM Land Registry data products</h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      The dataset is aligned with <a href="uk-product">UK companies that own property in England and Wales</a> which
      contains more than 3.2 million records of titles registered to a UK commercial organisation or corporate body.

    <p class="govuk-body">
      During more than 150 years of land registration, improvements to working practice may have caused some
      inconsistencies in the data.
    </p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>
        Only completed register entries are included. No pending applications or historic owners are included.
      </li>
      <li>
        HM Land Registry did not routinely record the country of incorporation in the register before January 1999.
      </li>
      <li>
        The information regarding owners may not always reflect the position on the Register, as we have removed
        private individuals, overseas companies and charities.
      </li>
      <li>
        The source data is from citizens and conveyancers supplied on registration deeds and documents. There
        is often inconsistency in the way addresses and names are supplied to HM Land Registry.
      </li>
      <li>
        There may be spelling errors in the names of the owners. This could be due to input error or the way
        the names were presented.
      </li>
      <li>
        Detailed address information is provided wherever possible.
      </li>
      <li>
        The postcode will be derived from the registered property description. If one hasn’t been registered then
        the postcode will be blank.
      </li>
      <li>
        The ‘Registered on’ date is the date the proprietor was registered. If there is more than one proprietor
        on the register it will be the date the latest proprietor was added. This could mean it is not when the
        overseas company was registered, but another proprietor on the register whose details are excluded.
      </li>
      <li>
        Y in the Multiple Address Indicator field indicates that property addresses on the register are contained
        in a Property Schedule. The register may contain additional property addresses. You’ll need to buy an
        official copy of the register to find out more about these addresses.
      </li>
      <li>
        Not every title will have an amount in the Price Paid field. These figures are taken from the monthly
        Price Paid information based on the latest application.

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="capture">Data capture information</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      The data is collected when property is transferred or leased to an overseas corporation. During the application
      process, the country of incorporation is recorded in the register. This has been the case since 1997.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      In some countries, a corporation is registered in a particular state or province. In this case, HM Land Registry
      enters both the state or province and the country. For example: #MONTBLANC HOLDINGS LIMITED# (incorporated in
      British Columbia, Canada).
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="maintenance">Data maintenance</h2>

      Two files will be published from the 2nd working day of the month. The data is published in both a monthly
      complete file and a file that only shows changes to the dataset since the previous month. This is known as
      the change only update file.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      Once the full dataset has been downloaded, the title number allows users to maintain the data by adding the
      change only update to the full dataset each month. Alternatively, the user can download the full dataset again,
      which also contains all changes made to date.
