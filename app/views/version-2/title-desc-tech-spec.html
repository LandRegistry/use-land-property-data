    <p class=govuk-body">
      The Title Descriptor dataset describes the estate or interest and class of title conferred on the estate or
      interest registered under each individual title number.
    </p>
    <p class=govuk-body">
      The Title Descriptor dataset along with the National Polygon dataset and the UPRN dataset comprise the complete
      National Polygon dataset. The Title Descriptor dataset describes the estate or interest and class of title
      conferred on each registered estate or interest in England and Wales. Each registered estate or interest is
      referenced by a Title Number.
    </p>
    <p class=govuk-body">
      The dataset also provides information about applications for registration currently being processed by Land
      Registry, but not yet completed.
    </p>
    <p class=govuk-body">
      An individual registered title will normally be either freehold or leasehold. A small number of titles are
      registered with intermixed freehold and leasehold estates where, on first registration, it was not possible to
      distinguish the respective freehold and leasehold extents. These titles will also have more than one class of
      title in respect of the freehold and leasehold extents.
    </p>
    <p class=govuk-body">
      Scheme titles were used to facilitate registration of areas of land acquired piecemeal for redevelopment. At the
      start of a scheme a title number was allocated with an outline title plan covering the intended extent which was
      gradually built up as the land was acquired. Within the scheme title there may be both possessory and absolute titles.
    </p>
    
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="scope">Specification scope</h2>
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Inclusion and exclusions</h3>
    <p class=govuk-body">
      The Title Descriptor data is a subset of the Land Register containing all registered titles relating to land or
      property. Every registered title will always have a title number, an estate and class of title. If there is an
      application awaiting registration there will be an associated title number, but no information will be provided
      regarding the estate and class of title.
    </p>
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Relationship to other HM Land Registry data products</h3>
    <p class=govuk-body">
      The Title descriptor dataset is one of three datasets that together with the <a href="nps-tech-spec">National
      Polygon dataset</a> and the <a href="title-number-tech-spec">Title Number and Unique Property Reference Number
      (UPRN) Look Up dataset</a> make the <a href="nps-product">National Polygon Service</a>. The separation of this
      data into three datasets means that each dataset is smaller and easier to handle and that data currency and
      updates can be more simply managed.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="identification">Data product identification</h2>
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Purpose</h3>
    <p class=govuk-body">
      HM Land Registry guarantees the titles it registers. The title granted is based on the type of estate, eg freehold
      or leasehold, and the strength of the evidence of title provided when an application is made for first registration.
      The class of title granted effectively describes the confidence the Registrar has in the registered owner’s title
      and the risk of this being disturbed. The class of title may be relevant to property professionals and mortgage
      lenders when dealing with the registered title.

      While we do our best to maintain the quality of our Title Descriptor data and ensure it conforms to the
      specification, occasionally small errors may occur. <a href="#contact">Any feedback</a> on the quality of this
      data is appreciated.

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="capture">Data capture information</h2>
    <p class=govuk-body">
      When an application is lodged to register land for the first time, the title deeds lodged as evidence of title
      reveal whether the land is held under freehold or leasehold tenure. Where there is an application to register
      a new lease out of land already registered, the new lease must be lodged.
    </p>
    <p class=govuk-body">
      The class of title given depends on the strength of the evidence of title lodged and the risk of that title
      being disturbed. There are 3 classes of title for freehold land and 4 for leasehold land. The best class of
      title is absolute. A qualified title may be granted if there is a specific defect in title. This defect will
      be specified in the register. A possessory title is normally granted where the title is held under adverse
      possession of unregistered land or the title deeds have been lost or destroyed. A good leasehold title may
      be granted where we do not have evidence of the landlord’s right to grant the lease. On a lease out of a
      registered title, we grant good leasehold where we do not have documentary evidence of the landlord’s title
      back to the freehold and the landlord’s title is not registered with absolute title.
    </p>

    <p class=govuk-body">
      The tenure of the title does not normally change. A long leasehold title can in certain circumstances be
      enlarged into a freehold.
    </p>
    <p class=govuk-body">
      Where the class of title is not absolute, an application can be made to upgrade the class of title. The
      evidence required to do this will depend on the current class of title, eg a qualified title will need
      evidence to remedy the defect in title entered in the register.
    </p>
