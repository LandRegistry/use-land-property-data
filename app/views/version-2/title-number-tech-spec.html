    <p class=govuk-body">
      This dataset contains HM Land Registry Title Numbers and AddressBase Unique Property Reference Numbers (UPRN).
      Customers can use this dataset to make relationships between National Polygon Dataset and other central and
      local Government data that uses AddressBase UPRNs.
    </p>
    
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="scope">Specification scope</h2>
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Inclusion and exclusions</h3>
    <p class=govuk-body">
      The Title Number and UPRN Look Up dataset is a subset of HM Land Registry’s Title Numbers, it is also a subset
      of the UPRNs supplied from AddressBase. Data is only included where HM Land Registry has made an association
      between a UPRN and Title Number.
    </p>
    <p class=govuk-body">
      HM Land Registry takes customer addresses at the point of registration and relate them to Ordnance Survey
      AddressBase data where possible. When a customer address does not relate to an AddressBase address, HM Land
      Registry will create a new address to relate our title to.
    </p>
    <p class=govuk-body">
      As more AddressBase addresses become available, we match HM Land Registry created addresses to new AddressBase
      addresses and create relationships where possible.
    </p>
    <p class=govuk-body">
      The title number / UPRN relationship will only be available for those titles where we have been able to make a
      relationship between our titles and AddressBase addresses.
    </p>
        
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Relationship to other HM Land Registry data products</h3>
    <p class=govuk-body">
      As this dataset contains the Title Number, the dataset can be linked to the Title Descriptor and National
      Polygon datasets (NPD). We have separated this data into three datasets to make each dataset smaller and easier
      to handle and so that data currency and updates can be more simply managed.
    </p>
    <p class=govuk-body">
      Relationships can be made between the Title Number and UPRN Look Up dataset and other information in the title
      register by linking through the title number, subject to the download or purchase of additional HM Land Registry data.

      <li>
        duplicate addresses may be created because either the information supplied with the application papers or

        result in two addresses in <abbr title="Land Registry Property Gazetteer">LRPG</abbr>, one with a Title Number

      </li>
      <li>
        an address exists with a UPRN but is not in <abbr title="Land Registry Property Gazetteer">LRPG</abbr> and

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="capture">Data capture information</h2>
    <p class=govuk-body">
      In the 1990s, HM Land Registry created its first national address database, populated with residential PAF
      addresses from Royal Mail. Before this we used addressing data sourced from street card indexes and local gazetteers.
    </p>
    <p class=govuk-body">
      In 2002, we moved to our current addressing database - <abbr title="Land Registry Property Gazetteer">LRPG</abbr>
      (Land Registry Property Gazetteer). <abbr title="Land Registry Property Gazetteer">LRPG</abbr> utilised
      AddressPoint data from the Ordnance Survey to provide a base of national addresses and where appropriate
      linked our customer address and title numbers to the AddressPoint address.
    </p>
    <p class=govuk-body">
      In 2011, HM Land Registry adopted Ordnance Survey MasterMap and moved from Address-Point to AddressLayer2.
    </p>
    <p class=govuk-body">
      In 2014, HM Land Registry moved from AddressLayer 2 to AddressBase as our source of national addresses.
      <abbr title="Land Registry Property Gazetteer">LRPG</abbr> ingests the post office PAF data from AddressBase to
      maintain consistency with the addressing that we used to take from AddressPoint and AddressLayer 2. By linking
      AddressBase data to our Title Numbers we have been able to create the Title Number / UPRN dataset.
    </p>
    <p class=govuk-body">
      A number of post office addresses that do not match Local Authority addresses have been excluded from AddressBase,
      though more and more are being added all the time, these addresses will not have a UPRN and so will not be
      available in this dataset.
    </p>
    <p class=govuk-body">
      A significant reason for HM Land Registry creating and managing Land Registry Property Gazetteer
      (<abbr title="Land Registry Property Gazetteer">LRPG</abbr>) is to enable us to make a relationship between
      our Title Number(s) and address(es). HM Land Registry caseworkers make this association as part of the
      registration process.
    </p>
    <p class=govuk-body">
      Where there is no address found in <abbr title="Land Registry Property Gazetteer">LRPG</abbr>, HM Land Registry
      creates its own. These addresses could be for non- addressable property or addressable property.
    </p>
    <p class=govuk-body">
      Where a Title Number affects many properties, all affecting UPRNs may be associated.
    </p>
    <p class=govuk-body">
      Where no AddressBase address has been ingested in <abbr title="Land Registry Property Gazetteer">LRPG</abbr>,
      no UPRN will be associated, even though one may exist.
    </p>
        
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="maintenance">Data maintenance</h2>
    <p class=govuk-body">
      HM Land Registry takes a six weekly change only update (<abbr title="change only update">COU</abbr>) of
      AddressBase. The data is ingested, data matching processes are managed with business rules and where appropriate,
      <abbr title="Land Registry Property Gazetteer">LRPG</abbr> is updated and Title associations are made.
    </p>
    <p class=govuk-body">
      During the six weeks, the data can change. The data that is published will only show the last updated change made.
