                        multiple lease indicator (the “Exploration Data”)

                    <li>does not affect any existing licence arrangements already in place. If you have access to other

                        by a Partner Body, those licensing arrangements continue to apply

                                It doesn’t matter if you’re not sure yet how Exploration Data might help you.
                                For example, you may want to assess it for a potential commercial opportunity or
                                see what potential benefits and value it could bring to you, helping you build
                                your case for licensing Exploration Data for use in your business or organisation
                                under a separate, commercial licensing arrangement with us.  Note these research and

                                using our data would work, which is ideal if you’re talking to potential customers,
                                agents, investors or other financial backers.  With our prior agreement, you can
                                also provide prototypes for a short time to any of these people on equivalent terms
                                to this Licence solely to help them to make a better assessment of your idea or proposition
